### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently studying in HSE Lyceum, one of top schools in Moscow, graduating in spring 2024.
## My life story-ish
- I have started programming learning **Scratch** (yeah the children one) and **Arduino C++** with some 3D modeling in **FreeCAD**, then moved onto **Python**.
- Completed a 2 year Python **Yandex Lyceum** course with distinction, where i built some projects in PyQT, pygame, flask and other stuff. 
- Built a few games in **Unity** and **C#** while participating in GameJams with my friends.
- Built a Toilet Finder Map app as my graduation work, had to learn **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** to complete it ;) (i'll link it here soon)
- Needed to learn how to frontend so completed **The Odin Project** basics.
- Currently working on a website with a map of restaurants with reviews and posts and blogs and lots of other cool stuff, for a school club-project called "Where to Eat?" (using ~HTMX~ svelte btw)
